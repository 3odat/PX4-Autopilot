  ```python
  await drone.action.arm()
  gps_position = await drone.telemetry.position()
  altitude = await drone.telemetry.altitude()
  await validate_sensors(drone)
  ```

### **Task: Battery & Communication Check**
- **Objective:** Validate UAV battery levels and signal strength.
- **MiniSpec Commands:**
  ```
  mb();
  ml();
  ```
- **MAVSDK Execution:**
  ```python
  async for battery in drone.telemetry.battery():
      print(f'Battery: {battery.remaining_percent * 100:.2f}%')
  async for signal in drone.telemetry.signal_strength():
      print(f'Signal Strength: {signal}')
  ```
