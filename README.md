**Research on Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for UAVs**  
### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZcKYiwtw1I&ab_channel=NeuralBreakdownwithAVB
## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores the integration of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into UAV autopilot systems using the **PX4 Autopilot framework**. Our goal is to:  

- **Generate high-quality datasets** (synthetic & handcrafted) for UAV mission planning.  
- **Fine-tune a small LLM (Phi-2)** using **Online Knowledge Distillation** from LLAMA3.  
- **Enhance security** by studying **attacks and vulnerabilities on LLMs** in UAV applications.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
✔ **Dataset Generation**: Creating synthetic & handcrafted UAV control datasets.  
✔ **Model Fine-Tuning**: Training **Phi-2** for UAV mission planning.  
✔ **Cybersecurity**: Investigating **prompt injection, adversarial attacks, and model vulnerabilities** in UAV-based LLMs.  
✔ **Performance Evaluation**: Analyzing fine-tuned models on **real-world UAV tasks**.  

## 🔬 Methodology  

### 1️⃣ Dataset Creation 📊  
- **Synthetic Data**: GPT-4/DeepSeek-based task generation.  
- **Handmade Data**: Manually crafted mission scenarios.  
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning, standardizing, and validating dataset quality.  

### 2️⃣ Fine-Tuning & Knowledge Distillation 🎯  
- **Teacher Model**: LLAMA3.3 (Baseline).  
- **Student Model**: Phi-2 (Lightweight UAV mission generator).  
- **Training Strategy**: Online Knowledge Distillation using **KL Divergence Loss**.  

### 3️⃣ Security Research on LLMs in UAVs 🔐  
- **LLM Vulnerabilities**: Testing **prompt injection, adversarial perturbations, and data poisoning**.  
- **Risk Mitigation**: Evaluating **defensive prompt engineering** & access controls.
