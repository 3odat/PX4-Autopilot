## Accomplishments

### üöÄ High-Level Skills Development
#### ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Operations
**Takeoff Implementation**  
- Developed the `takeoff` functionality for UAVs using both a formal definition and MAVSDK commands.
- Ensured safe altitude verification before proceeding with flight.
- MAVSDK Integration:
  ```python
  await self.drone.action.arm()
  await self.drone.action.takeoff()
  await asyncio.sleep(3)
  ```

**Landing Execution**  
- Created the `land` function to allow UAVs to descend and shut down safely.
- Implemented MAVSDK commands for safe landing and disarming:
  ```python
  await self.drone.action.land()
  await asyncio.sleep(5)
  await self.drone.action.disarm()
  ```

**Hovering Capability**  
- Integrated a hover function to maintain a UAV‚Äôs fixed position.
- Implemented a 10-second hover period using MAVSDK:
  ```python
  await self.drone.action.hold()
  await asyncio.sleep(10)
  ```

### üìç Navigation & Path Planning
**Waypoint Navigation**  
- Implemented `navigate_to_waypoint` to allow UAVs to move to predefined coordinates.
- Executed waypoint navigation via MAVSDK:
  ```python
  await self.drone.action.goto_location(latitude, longitude, altitude, yaw)
  ```

**Route Following**  
- Developed a function to follow a sequence of waypoints using:
  ```python
  for waypoint in route:
      await self.drone.action.goto_location(waypoint[0], waypoint[1], altitude, yaw)
  ```

**Return to Home Position**  
- Ensured safe return and landing using:
  ```python
  await self.drone.action.return_to_launch()
  await asyncio.sleep(5)
  await self.drone.action.disarm()
  ```

**Path Planning & Re-Planning**  
- Computed optimal flight paths and dynamically re-planned in response to obstacles.

### üõë Obstacle Handling
**Obstacle Detection & Avoidance**  
- Created detection and avoidance systems using sensor checks.
- Implemented emergency maneuvers if an obstacle is detected:
  ```python
  ?od()==True{mf(-5);tc(45);mf(5);}
  ```

### üîß Low-Level Skills Development
#### üìè Movement Controls
**Directional Movements**  
- Implemented precise control for forward, backward, left, right, up, and down movement.
- Example (Move Forward):
  ```python
  await self.drone.manual_control.set_manual_control_input(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
  await asyncio.sleep(time_based_on_distance)
  await self.drone.manual_control.set_manual_control_input(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
  ```

#### üîÑ Rotation & Positioning
- Developed rotation commands for clockwise and counterclockwise maneuvers.
- Integrated circular motion functionality for aerial surveying.

#### üïπÔ∏è Sensors & Interaction
- Implemented object tracking and distance measurement capabilities.

#### üì° System & Control
- Developed essential UAV control features, including motor arming/disarming and altitude measurement.

### üåê Web UI Development
- Designed and deployed a Web UI on **Server 3070** for remote drone control.
- Established seamless communication between the Web UI and UAV control system.

---

## Next Steps
- Further optimize navigation and obstacle avoidance algorithms.
- Enhance Web UI with real-time telemetry and control feedback.
- Conduct additional flight tests to validate system reliability.
