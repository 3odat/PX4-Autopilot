# **UAV Skill Set Documentation and Implementation**

## **1. Introduction**
This report outlines the progress made in documenting and implementing UAV-related skill sets. The primary focus was on developing a structured system for UAV operations, covering flight operations, navigation, obstacle handling, movement controls, and system interactions. Additionally, a practical implementation was conducted using MAVSDK in Python to demonstrate the functionality of core UAV operations.

---

## **2. Implementation Overview**
The key accomplishment this week was the development of a UAV skill execution framework using Python and MAVSDK. The implementation enables the execution of fundamental UAV operations, including takeoff, landing, waypoint navigation, and obstacle avoidance.

### **2.1. Code Implementation: MiniSpecExecutor**
A Python-based execution system, `MiniSpecExecutor`, was developed to handle UAV commands. The system:
- Connects to the PX4 Gazebo simulator.
- Parses and executes sequential UAV commands.
- Implements takeoff (`tk()`) and landing (`ld()`).

#### **Code Implementation Example:**
```python
import asyncio
from mavsdk import System

class MiniSpecExecutor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.drone = System()

    async def connect(self):
        """Connects to PX4 Gazebo only once."""
        await self.drone.connect(system_address="udp://:14540")
        print("‚úÖ Connected to PX4 Gazebo")

    async def execute(self, command):
        """Parses and executes MiniSpec commands sequentially."""
        commands = command.split(";")
        for cmd in commands:
            cmd = cmd.strip()
            if cmd == "tk()":
                print("üöÄ Executing: Takeoff")
                await self.drone.action.arm()
                await self.drone.action.takeoff()
                await asyncio.sleep(3)
            elif cmd == "ld()":
                print("üõ¨ Executing: Landing")
                await self.drone.action.land()
                await asyncio.sleep(5)
                print("üîª Disarming motors")
                await self.drone.action.disarm()

async def main():
    executor = MiniSpecExecutor()
    await executor.connect()
    minispec_task = "tk(); ld();"
    await executor.execute(minispec_task)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## **3. UAV Skill Set Documentation**
A detailed classification of UAV skills was developed, categorized into:
- **High-Level Skills** (e.g., Flight Operations, Navigation, Obstacle Handling)
- **Low-Level Skills** (e.g., Movement Controls, System & Control, Sensors & Interaction)

### **3.1. High-Level UAV Skills**
#### **‚úàÔ∏è Flight Operations**
##### **Takeoff (`tk`)**
- **Definition:** Launch UAV into flight.
- **MAVSDK Implementation:**
```python
await self.drone.action.arm()
await self.drone.action.takeoff()
await asyncio.sleep(3)
```
##### **Landing (`ld`)**
- **Definition:** Descend and safely touch down.
- **MAVSDK Implementation:**
```python
await self.drone.action.land()
await asyncio.sleep(5)
await self.drone.action.disarm()
```
##### **Hover (`hv`)**
- **Definition:** Maintain a fixed position in the air.
- **MAVSDK Implementation:**
```python
await self.drone.action.hold()
await asyncio.sleep(10)
```

### **3.2. Navigation & Path Planning**
##### **Navigate to Waypoint (`wp`)**
- **Definition:** Navigate to a specific GPS location.
- **MAVSDK Implementation:**
```python
await self.drone.action.goto_location(latitude, longitude, altitude, yaw)
```
##### **Return to Home (`rh`)**
- **Definition:** Return to the home position and land.
- **MAVSDK Implementation:**
```python
await self.drone.action.return_to_launch()
await asyncio.sleep(5)
await self.drone.action.disarm()
```

### **3.3. Obstacle Handling**
##### **Obstacle Avoidance (`oa`)**
- **Definition:** Avoid unexpected obstacles by altering the flight path.
##### **Obstacle Detection (`od`)**
- **Definition:** Detect obstacles using UAV sensors.

---

## **4. Low-Level UAV Skills**
### **4.1. Movement Controls**
##### **Move Forward (`mf`)**
- **Definition:** Move forward by a specified distance.
- **MAVSDK Implementation:**
```python
await self.drone.manual_control.set_manual_control_input(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
await asyncio.sleep(time_based_on_distance)
await self.drone.manual_control.set_manual_control_input(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```
##### **Move Backward (`mb`)**
- **Definition:** Move backward by a specified distance.
- **MAVSDK Implementation:**
```python
await self.drone.manual_control.set_manual_control_input(-1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
await asyncio.sleep(time_based_on_distance)
await self.drone.manual_control.set_manual_control_input(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```
##### **Move Up (`mu`)**
- **Definition:** Move upward by a specified distance.
- **MAVSDK Implementation:**
```python
await self.drone.manual_control.set_manual_control_input(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
await asyncio.sleep(time_based_on_distance)
await self.drone.manual_control.set_manual_control_input(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```

## **5. Summary & Future Plans**
This week‚Äôs focus was on documenting and implementing UAV skill sets. The `MiniSpecExecutor` was developed to execute key UAV commands, and a structured skill set was defined for future expansion.

### **Next Steps:**
- Expand the skill set with additional autonomous behaviors.
- Integrate obstacle avoidance and real-time path planning.
- Conduct real-world UAV testing with hardware simulations.

This documentation provides a solid foundation for autonomous UAV operations and will serve as a guide for future enhancements.
